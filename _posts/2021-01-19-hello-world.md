This is it! I'm doing the blog thing... again! Yeah, yeah, this is not my firsty first... I promise this time I won't quit.

I'm hosting this on my [personal github page](https://pages.github.com/) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because I can and it's free. And because I love Ruby and markdown as well!

I'm using a particularly [beautiful Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) for which I thank its author, [Dean Attali](https://github.com/daattali){:target="_blank"}.

Sorry, what are you asking right now? What are you going to talk about here?
Mainly geek stuff but mostly random things which I need to get out of my head. Might be about books I'm reading, films I'm watching, games I'm playing, stressfull things stressing my spirit, etc.


Without further ado, ![Let's get started!](https://media.giphy.com/media/j3neEXkCnF2sHOO0NO/giphy.gif)

Right now, I'm reading [Servant of the Shard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_of_the_Shard) by R.A. Salvatore, the 13th book in the Drizzt Do'Urden book series. Actually I skipped this because I didn't read the [suggested reading order](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/9430/chronological-order-of-the-drizzt-series) correctly and I caught up before starting [The Ghost King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_King). Well, I also discovered Servant of the Shard is also the first book of a separate trilogy named [The Sellswords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sellswords) and honestly... I love Artemis Entreri's character. He's not the typical villain and he turns out to be mostly a normal human being with a grey aura instead of a villain black one. Entreri with Jarlaxle, don't make me start... Jarlaxle is another very interesting character, more black haloed for sure but still very human for a drow.

What am I watching these days? Well, I'm not a binge watcher at all, I'm actually very reasonable! Over the last 3 months I've been catching up the Defenders series on Netflix and I recently started The Punisher after watching Dare Devil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist and The Defenders series itself. I really like the general for-grown-ups tone of the 6 series even if there's a lot of drinking, blood, drugs... I'm not fond of this myself... But I get why the characters do what they do in context of a major human race crisis.
Anyway, I took a pause from Marvel the last 2 weeks, because I found the Atypical series. There's not many series talking about ASD and most of them sucks in one way or another. Most of them never really mentions autism explicitly (I'm thinking about Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory) or just depicts people with ASD as rain-man-geniuses. Atypical talks about ASD in just the right tone, using the right words and showing what is like living with autism or with a loved one with ASD. The series main public is teenagers, or at least that's what I understand, but I enjoy it very much as a 40YO man with autism, or presumed autism... (more info in the [about](/aboutme) page). It's also funny and full of american way of life clich√©s (I love those!).
