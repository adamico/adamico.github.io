Welcome to part 2 of my Minecraft modding voyage!

As a preamble I want to say I'm not a IDE guy. I use VIM and a bit of Sublime Text in my Linux machines and sometimes in Windows too.
But I really liked the IntelliJ Idea IDE and I'm going to use it for Java and Minecraft modding.

Most of the info I'm writing here comes either from https://thebookofmodding.ml/, https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/1.16.x/ and https://codakid.com/guide-to-minecraft-modding-with-java/ (even if this guide is a bit obsolete since it's for MC 1.12).

1. Install [JDK 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot)
2. Install [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
3. Download 1.16.5 [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.5.html) and extract the 1.16.5-36.0.45/forge-1.16.5-36.0.45-mdk.zip file
