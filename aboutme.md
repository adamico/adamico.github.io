My name is Andrea D'Amico and I want to be a pir... Erm, sorry wrong game!

Let's try again.

My name is Andrea D'Amico and I have **autism**. Boom! I said it!

![I said it!](https://media.giphy.com/media/cdfDupJpBDcV2iN6Uv/giphy.gif)

Do my autism define myself? **Yes and no**.

**Yes**, because being on the autistic spectrum comes from a different way of neuronal wiring in my brain. I think differently, I speak my own language, I process sensitive information in my own way.

**No**, because I can live my own life without external help beside my family. It's hard but I do have a family, a job, I can cook my own food, I can drive. It *is* hard, though. I get stressed when I experience:

- sudden noises, especially specific frequencies
- harsh light and specific patterns
- specific smells
- unexpected physical touching, especially with very light pressure
- new places
- new people

My social interactions are impaired:

- I don't understand social rules when they're not said explicitly.
- I react to other people feelings and emotion with delay
- Making and keeping relationships is very hard for me
- I don't understant how a society can work as a whole

My verbal skills are also impaired:

- I can't decipher implicit phrase meanings or I'm very slow when I can.
- I can't speak for the sake of speaking, I can't have small talk with others

I have repetitve behaviors and interests:

- I need to eat the same foods
- I spin my wedding ring when I'm stressed
- I repeat new words or phrases in my head
- I cannot divert my attention to anything else when I am involved in something I like
- I cannot stop talking about what I like

All of these facts define what I am and have an influence on all my activites. It doesn't mean I can't resist, I **can**, but at **what cost**? I exhaust myself controlling or hiding my autism  In my everyday life I have to control my autism because I'm too different from the average earthling. That's my disability. Living in a neurotypical society takes a toll on the energy I have to do what I have to do everyday.

I'm autist but I also am a father, a husband, a physician, a web developer, a gamer, a writer, a musician, a photographer...

I love reading SF, fantasy, ucronic, post-apocalypse, utopian and dystopian novels.

I love watching horror, SF, romantic, super-heroes movies and series.

I love sports with wheels, roller blades, foot scooters, bicycle.

I love the technical aspects of everything.

I love words, etymology, ancient languages.

I will write about all of this, and more!
